# BlockBreaker

This is a group project completed toward the end of the Fall 2017 university semester as a final project for a class titled CS 120 -
Advanced Programming. The program simulates a standard block breaking game where a player bounces a moving ball off of a bar and hits
colored blocks in order to accrue points. I wrote the code for this project in collaboration with two other students, Griffin Cohen and
Ben Spenciner. I contributed primarily to the Ball.cpp file by working on the Ball constructor and creating the Ball velocity reversal
methods and collision detection flags. Additionally, I contributed heavily to the Graphics.cpp file by setting Block instances and handling
the Ball collision logic.
